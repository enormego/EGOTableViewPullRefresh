# How to use this library

1. Add this repo as a git submodule in your project (or clone and copy it if you aren't using git for your project) 
2. Add the EGOTableViewPullRefresh/EGOTableViewPullRefresh.xcodeproj as a sub-project
3. Add the EGOTableViewPullRefresh.xcodeproj/EGOResources.bundle to the resources group in your project
4. Add a target dependency on the EGOTableViewPullRefresh LIB to your project target(s)

With this, you should be setup to use the project as a LIB and it's resources should be incorporated into your project's resources.
